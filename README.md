# next steps

for each patch compute:

patch level p_i \approx \gamma * \lambda / \beta u # u right eigen vector of A

occupancy probability near threshold. 

gives us a way to look at expected total "damage"  \gamma * \lambda /\beta \sum_{i \in Manager} u_i 

can compare this for globally-knowledgable/concerned manager vs locally-knowledgable/concerned

can show tradeoff. expect in some network topos the greedy/locally focused has different effects.
expect more noticable when we combine budgets -- someone in a safe zone could contribute to the global more. 

todo

- work up something like this
- consolidate writeup / scenarios



for next week

- just now gettting to some of the questions: asymetric info, total damage/benefits, et
- clear writeup of scenarios
- visual of the scenarios / groups: info, control (conceptual fig: contorl and info as different directed edges; coming from a _group of nodes_)
- visual related to total damage
- existing visual of 

asks: 

- motivation/references/paragraphs
- lanaguage/framing/terms


future

- could have different objective w/ weighted sum involving damage etc; this involves opt for eigenvector perturb not the eigen value
